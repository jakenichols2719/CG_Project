CSCI 4229 Project by James Nichols

This project was completed (but not yet) as the final for CSCI 4229 in the summer semester
of 2020. It simulates a carnival shooting minigame and a bit of the surrounding
environment.

Controls:
Arrow keys: Rotate camera
Space bar: Fire (at center of screen)

The rest of the textures are made by me.

As of Sun. June 28, I have spent 35-40 hrs (outside of preexisting code from hw3)
on this assignment.

There are some issues that are hardware-dependent with the particle system that I am unsure of how to fix, but all other aspects work as intended.
